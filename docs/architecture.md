# Architecture

A concise map of the runtime's boundaries as implemented so far. Requirements
are in [`design.md`](design.md); the supported/deferred list and exact commands
are in the [README](../README.md). This note describes what exists and labels
planned shapes as planned.

No JavaScript source frontend exists yet. Every program in the tests and the
example is hand-assembled bytecode (`Assembler`): an early VM test tool, not
JavaScript source support.

```

- **Runtime** (`src/runtime.rs`): the shared heap and task bookkeeping. It
  spawns tasks and opens heap scopes; it never runs anything by itself.
- **Executable** (`src/vm/executable.rs`): code validated once at load and then
  shared read-only by every task running it (`Executable::same_code`). It holds
  no heap references, so it is not tied to one runtime.
- **Task** (`src/task.rs`, `src/vm/frames.rs`): all execution state lives in the
  task's `VmState`: instruction position, operand stack, locals and diagnostic
  context (one frame for now; explicit call frames are pellet clj-quickjs-4).
  A worker thread only borrows it for one run.
- **Handles** (`src/heap/roots.rs`): embedders never see raw values. `Rooted`
  is a persistent root (how results are returned); `Local<'s>` is valid only
  inside `Runtime::scope`. A Rust local holding a raw value is not a root.
- **Host** (`src/host.rs`): the narrow embedder trait for leaf effects, passed
  as `&mut dyn Host` to one run.

## Run protocol

1. `Task::try_begin_run` takes the task's execution guard with `try_lock`. It
   never blocks: a second runner gets `RunError::AlreadyRunning`, so a task can
   never execute on two workers at once.
2. `RunGuard::run_with(budget, host)` runs the dispatch loop
   (`src/vm/dispatch.rs`) on the task's `VmState`.
3. The run ends with one `RunOutcome`:

| Outcome          | Task afterwards | Meaning |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| `Complete(root)` | `Finished`      | returned a value, delivered as a persistent root |
| `Failed(error)`  | `Finished`      | runtime failure with executable/task/world/instruction diagnostics |
| `Yielded`        | `Ready`         | the instruction budget ran out; state saved in the task |
| `Waiting(key)`   | (reserved)      | not produced yet; see the continuation shape below |

4. The guard is released when the run returns. No Rust stack frame, borrow, or
   lock survives between runs, so the next run may happen on any thread.

**Budget and yield points.** `Budget::instructions(n)` bounds the instructions
one run executes; `Budget::UNLIMITED` (used by `Task::run`) does not. The
budget is checked only between instructions. Before an instruction executes the
loop advances the saved position, so on `Yielded` the position names the next
instruction (possibly a branch target just jumped to) and the operands and
locals are exactly what that instruction expects. Every instruction therefore
executes once, in exactly one run: a resumed run never replays an instruction
or its effect. A zero budget yields without executing anything.

## Leaf host effects

`HostEffect op` (opcode `0x11`) pops one primitive argument, calls
`Host::effect(HostCall { task, op, arg })` synchronously, and pushes the
returned primitive. This is the "leaf native operation" of `design.md` §10:

- it may not reenter the VM: while an effect runs, starting a run on that
  thread fails with `RunError::InsideHostEffect` (a guard acquired earlier
  fails its task instead), and `Runtime::scope` panics;
- it may not allocate or hold heap values across suspension: it sees only
  root-free primitives (an object argument fails the task with
  `UnsupportedOperand` before the host is called) and gets no heap access;
- it may not suspend: it can only return a value or an error (the error fails
  the task with `VmErrorKind::HostEffect`).

`Task::run` supplies no host; effects then fail the task.

Resumable natives that invoke JavaScript or wait on dependencies need a
task-owned native continuation instead of a Rust call; that is pellet
clj-quickjs-12.

## Task/dependency continuation shape (planned)

Dependency waits reuse the same mechanism as `Yielded`: the task returns from
the run, and all state needed to continue stays in the task.

- A demanding instruction reads a dependency cell keyed by
  world/version + definition/query id + result kind. If the result is ready,
  the read is recorded as a dependency edge and execution continues in the
  same run.
- If it is unavailable, the instruction leaves the saved position on itself
  (it has no effect to replay), registers the task's identity as the wake
  handle, and the run returns `Waiting(key)`. No JavaScript callback, promise,
  or Rust stack represents the continuation.
- When the result is published, the host requeues the task (outside any cell
  or waiter lock) and calls `run_with` again, on any worker; the instruction
  re-reads the now-ready cell and continues.

Dependency cells, wait registration and race-safe wakeups are pellets
clj-quickjs-6, -23 and -7; the reference executor is clj-quickjs-8.

## QuickJS references and provenance

Consulted (Bellard upstream `https://github.com/bellard/quickjs.git`, revision
`7d1c13c5d8f8c6b32893786ed35cdcebd88194d2`, `VERSION` 2026-06-04), as design
references only:

- `research/quickjs/quickjs.c`: `JSAsyncFunctionState` and the
  `JS_CallInternal` generator-resume branch (saved `cur_pc`, `cur_sp`, argument
  and variable buffers) for what a saved continuation must contain;
  `js_poll_interrupts` (a decrementing per-context counter) as the analogue of
  the instruction budget. QuickJS keeps frames on the C stack and resumes
  generators through promises; neither is used here.
- `research/quickjs/doc/quickjs.texi`, "Function call": QuickJS frames live on
  the system stack, which is the property this design replaces with
  task-owned frames.
