# clj-quickjs

A Rust-native JavaScript runtime for highly concurrent compile-time execution.
Requirements: [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md). Backlog: Pellets (`pl list`).

This is an architectural slice in progress, not a finished JavaScript engine.
No JavaScript source frontend exists yet.

## Build and test

The toolchain comes from `flake.nix` (`nix develop` if `cargo` is not on PATH).

```sh
cargo build --all-targets
cargo test --all-targets          # unit + integration tests
cargo test --doc                  # doc tests, including compile-fail handle tests
cargo run                         # early VM test program (hand-assembled bytecode)
cargo run --example resumable_counter   # budgeted yield/resume with a host counter
cargo test --lib resume_tests     # yield/resume and host-effect unit tests
cargo test --test resumable       # resume on another embedder thread
cargo test --test gc              # collection through the embedding API
cargo test --lib heap::           # collector, native payloads, root categories
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Crate layout

Library (`src/lib.rs`) plus a thin binary (`src/main.rs`). Modules:
`runtime` (embedding entry point, `collect`), `task` (task state, execution
guard, run outcomes), `vm` (instruction format, executable validation,
task-owned frames, dispatch, test assembler), `heap` (object identity, roots,
scoped and weak handles, tracing contract, mark/sweep collector), `value`,
`ids`, `error`, `host` (leaf host effects). See
the `lib.rs` crate docs and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Supported and deferred

### VM core (clj-quickjs-1)

Supported:

- Embedding API: `Runtime`, immutable shared `Executable`, `Task`,
  persistent `Rooted` handles, scoped `Local` handles (`Runtime::scope`), and
  `RunOutcome::{Complete, Failed}`. The embedder drives tasks with
  `Task::run` on its own threads; the runtime owns no threads.
- Execution guard: a task being run cannot be run again concurrently
  (`RunError::AlreadyRunning`, never blocks); finished tasks report
  `RunError::Finished`.
- A new byte instruction format, validated at load time (unknown opcodes,
  truncated operands, bad indices and branch targets, stack underflow and
  depth mismatches, falling off the end): constants, `undefined`, local
  get/set, `pop`, `dup`, number `add`/`sub`/`mul`/`lt`, `===`, `!`, `jump`,
  `jump_if_false`, `return`, and allocation of property-less objects. The
  opcode table is in `src/vm/instr.rs`.
- Task-owned VM state (instruction position, operands, locals, diagnostic
  context); failures report executable, task, world, instruction and opcode.
- Stable object identity across tasks and runs; task results are persistent
  roots that outlive the task.

Deferred (explicitly not implemented):

- JavaScript source: programs are hand-assembled bytecode (`Assembler`), an
  early VM test tool, not JavaScript source support.
- `Waiting` is reserved but never produced (`Yielded` and budgets: see
  clj-quickjs-16 below).
- Garbage collection: superseded, see clj-quickjs-2 below.
- Arithmetic on non-number operands fails with `UnsupportedOperand` instead of
  applying JavaScript coercions. No strings, properties, calls, closures,
  exceptions, collections, atoms or dependency cells yet.

### Budgeted yield and leaf host effects (clj-quickjs-16)

Supported:

- `Task::run_with(Budget, &mut dyn Host)`: a run executes at most
  `Budget::instructions(n)` instructions and returns `RunOutcome::Yielded` when
  the budget runs out. Instruction position, operands and locals stay in the
  task; the next run, on any thread, continues at the saved instruction
  (including a branch target). The budget is checked only between
  instructions, so no instruction or effect is ever replayed.
- `host_effect op` (opcode `0x11`): a non-reentrant leaf host effect through the
  `Host` trait. It takes and returns primitives only, cannot reenter the VM
  (`RunError::InsideHostEffect`), open a heap scope, or suspend. Host errors
  fail the task (`VmErrorKind::HostEffect`); `Task::run` supplies no host.
- Example: `cargo run --example resumable_counter` round-robins two tasks with
  a budget of 5 instructions and prints the host counter once per effect.
  Hand-assembled bytecode: an early VM test, not JavaScript source support.

Deferred:

- `Waiting(key)` and dependency waits (pellets clj-quickjs-6, -23, -7).
- Resumable natives that call JavaScript or suspend (clj-quickjs-12); a
  scheduler/executor with budgets (clj-quickjs-8). Budgets count instructions
  only, not time or allocation.

### Garbage collection (clj-quickjs-2)

Supported:

- A precise, nonmoving, stop-the-world mark/sweep collector over the one
  shared heap (`src/heap/gc.rs`). `Runtime::collect()` is the deterministic
  "collect now" entry point; it returns `CollectStats` (roots, live,
  reclaimed). Unreachable objects are reclaimed, cycles included; reachable
  objects keep their identity and storage address.
- Roots: persistent `Rooted` handles (including task results), locals of
  open `Runtime::scope` scopes, and every live task's saved frames (operands
  and locals) plus its executable's constants. Native heap objects report
  their payload edges through `Trace`. Later root kinds (dependency results,
  atoms, closures, native continuations) register through the same
  `RootSource` boundary.
- A Rust variable is not a root: `WeakHandle` (`Rooted::downgrade`,
  `Scope::downgrade`) names an object without keeping it alive. After
  reclamation `upgrade` fails with `HandleError::Reclaimed`, even when the
  object's storage slot has been reused (slot generations are checked on
  every lookup).
- Finishing a task releases its frames but not its allocations: a returned
  value lives as long as its `Rooted` result.

Deferred:

- Collection while tasks run: `collect` refuses with
  `CollectError::MutatorActive` (it never waits) while any `RunGuard` exists
  or a scope is open on another thread. Cooperative safepoints and mutator
  registration are pellet clj-quickjs-17; executor integration is
  clj-quickjs-25; per-root-kind coverage is clj-quickjs-31.
- No automatic collection trigger (allocation never collects), no
  generational, concurrent or compacting collection, and no worker-local
  allocation buffers.
- Heap-object constants in executables: the constant-pool edge is traced,
  but loaded code still accepts only primitive constants.
